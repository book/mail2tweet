I'm subscribed to a mailing-list were people send interesting articles,
usually as a link followed by the full text (for archival, as URL tend
to become obsolete over time).

The link are interesting enough that they could be shared with more
people. Enters Twitter. I want to tweet a summary of the emails:
simply the subject line and the first URL in the body.

mail2tweet gets the oldest email matching the given criteria,
and tweets subject and first link from an email on stdin.

The YAML config files hold the credentials, "last email tweeted",
and content-munging information.

    # example use in a crontab
    */5 * * * * mail2tweet --config config.yml

    # example config.yml

      subject:

        - '^(?:(?i:Fwd|Re): *)*'
      body:
        - 'https?://(?:\S+\.)?example.(?:biz|com|net)'
        - '#!/'
