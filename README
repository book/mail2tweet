I'm subscribed to a mailing-list were people send interesting articles,
usually as a link followed by the full text (for archival, as URL tend
to become obsolete over time).

The link are interesting enough that they could be shared with more
people. Enters Twitter.

mail2tweet is actually made of two separate tools:
- dump1mail:  dumps on stdout the oldest email matching criteria
- mail2tweet: tweets subject and first link from an email on stdin

The YAML config files old the credential, "last email tweeted",
and content-munging information.

    # example use in a crontab
    */5 * * * * while ! dump1mail --config imap.yml | mail2tweet --config twitter.yml ; do true ; done
